# Stickify

Stickify is my digital solution to replace the wall of sticky notes cluttering my workspace.
This personal project lets me create, organize and manage virtual notes in collections, maintaining my visual thinking style without the physical mess.
Built as a coding hobby project it evolves as my skills and needs grow.
